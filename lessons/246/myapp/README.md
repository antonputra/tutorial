TCP vs UDP Performance (C++) | can i measure packet loss? diagram of tcp vs udp

UDP does not requre connection
tcp is more secure
bind IP and Port to socket
after socket is bound we transition to listening
how many packets and bytes we can transfer
use cases -> video/audio streaming
you can build higher lavel protocol on top of UDP to verify data integrate -> example tftp
Why would you use an unreliable underlying protocol? Two reasons: speed and speed.
It’s way faster to fire-and-forget than it is to keep track of what has arrived safely and make sure it’s in order and all that.
